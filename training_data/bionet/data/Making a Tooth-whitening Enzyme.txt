Example: Making a Tooth-whitening Enzyme 

To make a tooth whitening product, you can fuse an enamel-binding peptide with a perhydrolase.

The resulting fusion protein will hopefully be retained on the teeth longer than a perhydrolase enzyme only.  

The enamel-binding peptide will bind the tooth enamel and the perhydrolase will whiten the teeth. 

A perhydrolase catalyzes the reversible formation of peracids from carboxylic acids and hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide 

Using hydrogen peroxide in a rinse or a paste may help whiten your teeth. But a high concentration may cause side effects, including damaging your teeth.

The customer requires design and production of 50 mg each of the fusion protein and the perhydrolase-only control for evaluation and testing.

The workflow includes contract lab testing of enzyme activity retention after toothbrushing. 

In some use cases, it may not be desirable for affinity purification tags to be added to the fusion protein.
